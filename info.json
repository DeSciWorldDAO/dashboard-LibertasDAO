The platform should be accessible to scientists from all fields to publish their research and conduct peer reviews to improve transparency and verifiability. The DAO will be based on blockchain technology.Libertas aims to create incentives for scientists to publish their research on the platform and conduct peer reviews. Tokens are offered that provide members with a financial value for their contributions. The revenue for members depends on the number of their tokens and contributions and can range from 10 to 10,000 euros. Through these financial incentives, Libertas seeks to overcome barriers in the current prestige system and promote global research.",
